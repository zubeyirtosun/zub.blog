## 2. Quality Management System (QMS - ISO 9001)

### PDCA Cycle (PUKÖ Döngüsü)
Used for **continual improvement**.
- **Plan:** Establish objectives and standards. *(PDF: Issue 3 & 4, Page 10)*
- **Do:** Implement the plans. *(PDF: Issue 3 & 4, Page 10)*
- **Check:** Monitor and measure results against standards. *(PDF: Issue 3 & 4, Page 10)*

### 7 Quality Management Principles (7 Kalite Yönetim Prensibi)
1. **Customer Focus (Müşteri Odaklılık):** Striving to exceed customer expectations.
2. **Leadership (Liderlik):** Providing unity of purpose and direction.
3. **Engagement of People (Kişilerin Bağlılığı):** Utilizing the abilities of people at all levels.
4. **Process Approach (Süreç Yaklaşımı):** Managing activities and resources as a process.
5. **Improvement (İyileştirme):** Making continual improvement a permanent objective.
6. **Evidence-based Decision Making (Kanıta Dayalı Karar Verme):** Decisions based on the analysis of data.
7. **Relationship Management (İlişki Yönetimi):** Maintaining mutually beneficial relationships with stakeholders (e.g., suppliers). 
*(PDF: Issue 3 & 4, Pages 11-17)*

### Documentation Hierarchy (Dokümantasyon Hiyerarşisi)
- **Quality Manual:** Explains the scope of the QMS and the interaction between processes. *(PDF: Issue 4, Page 7)*

- **Records:** Evidence of activities performed or results achieved. *(PDF: Issue 4, Page 6)*

### Key Concepts in Quality
> **Inherent vs. Assigned Characteristics:** "Inherent" characteristics determine quality (e.g., engine torque). "Assigned" characteristics (e.g., price) are not quality features. *(PDF: Issue 3 & 4, Pages 3-4)*

> **Corrective vs. Preventive Action:**
> - **Corrective Action:** Taken to eliminate the cause of a detected nonconformity (i.e., after a problem occurs).
> - **Preventive Action:** Taken to eliminate the cause of a potential nonconformity (i.e., before a problem occurs).

## 3. Environmental Management System (EMS - ISO 14001)

> **Purpose:** A set of processes that enables an organization to reduce its environmental impacts and increase its operational efficiency. *(PDF: Issue 5 & 6, Page 2)*

### Rules of Implementation (Uygulama Kuralları)
- **Environmental Policy:** The organization must establish and maintain an environmental policy.
- **Life Cycle Planning:** Planning must consider the entire life cycle of the product.
- **Stakeholder Contact:** Permanent communication must be established with stakeholders regarding environmental protection.
- **Cleaner Technologies:** Companies are continuously pushed to implement cleaner technologies.

### Key Concepts in EMS
> **EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme):** A "premium" voluntary instrument from the European Commission for organizations to evaluate and report their environmental performance. Its key difference from ISO 14001 is the mandatory publication of a verified **Environmental Report**. *(PDF: Issue 5 & 6, Pages 14, 18)*

> **BAT (Best Available Techniques):** The most effective and advanced techniques that are economically and technically viable. This concept replaced the older "BATNEEC" (Best Available Technology Not Entailing Excessive Cost). *(PDF: Issue 5 & 6, Pages 20-21)*

> **Cleaner Production (Temiz Üretim):** A preventive strategy that optimizes resource use and reduces waste at the source. Techniques include: technology changes, input material changes, product design changes, and good housekeeping practices. *(PDF: Issue 5 & 6, Page 27)*

## 4. Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S - ISO 45001)

### Key OH&S Definitions
| Term (English) | Türkçe Karşılığı | Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hazard** | Tehlike | A source or situation with the potential for harm (e.g., injury or ill health). *(PDF: Issue 7, Page 17)* |
| **Risk** | Risk | The combination of the likelihood of a hazardous event and the severity of the harm. *(PDF: Issue 7, Page 21)* |
| **Incident** | Olay | A work-related event in which an injury or ill health occurred or could have occurred. |
| **Acceptable Risk**| Kabul Edilebilir Risk | Risk that has been reduced to a level that can be tolerated by the organization, having regard to its legal obligations. |
| **Nonconformity** | Uygunsuzluk | The non-fulfilment of a requirement. |

### Obligations (Yükümlülükler)
- **Employer (İşveren):** Must assess and document risks, inform employees, and consult with them and their representatives. *(PDF: Issue 7, Page 13)*
- **Worker (Çalışan):** Must use equipment and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) correctly and report dangers immediately. *(PDF: Issue 7, Page 12)*

### ISO 45001 vs. OHSAS 18001
ISO 45001 replaced the older OHSAS 18001 standard with several key differences:
- **Worker Wellness:** ISO 45001 explicitly includes the promotion of worker wellness and wellbeing.
- **Leadership:** It places a much stronger emphasis on top management leadership and worker participation.
- **Structure:** It follows the **High-Level Structure (HLS)**, making it compatible with other standards like ISO 9001 and ISO 14001.

> **High-Level Structure (HLS):** A common framework for all modern ISO management system standards. Key clauses like **Clause 4 (Context of the organization)**, **Clause 5 (Leadership)**, and **Clause 6 (Planning)** are standardized, simplifying integration.

### OH&S Ratios
- **Accident Frequency (AF - Kaza Sıklığı):** *(PDF: Issue LAST, Page 21)*
  ```
  AF = (Number of accidents / Number of workers) * 1000
  ```
- **Accident Severity (AS - Kaza Şiddeti):** *(PDF: Issue LAST, Page 21)*
  ```
  AS = Total number of days lost / Number of accidents
  ```
